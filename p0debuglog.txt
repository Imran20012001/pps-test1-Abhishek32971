b  main - break at main function
r run the program till break point
n when the line has a std library function call
  or any line
s line has user defined function call
p is used print value of the variable. When ever the   value 

c return statement in the main 
l list the code 

All printfs should have \n in the end except it is optional for those followed by scanf.

Basic principle of modularition.

input  should not call any compute functions.
compute should not call any input or output functions.
output should not call any input or compute function.

No global variables.
